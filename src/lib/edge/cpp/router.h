 * The router provides the ability to broadcast, multicast, or 
 * unicast data between cells, or between cells and other objects
 * like planes or groups. The router maintains an edge to
 * every cell in the group, as well as two or more edges to every 
 * group in the lattice.
 *
 * There are to global, persistent planes. One is the control
 * plane, which provides a publish/subscribe model. Every
 * object in the lattice connects to the control plane. The
 * control planes for all groups in a lattice are also connected
 * together.
 *
 * The other global plane is the data plane.
